Stanford's [Ethics, Technology & Public Policy Course](https://ethicsandtech.stanford.edu/) offered a critical lens on topics ranging from privacy and surveillance, algorithmic fairness, impacts of automation on workers and the implications of private sector platforms for democratic institutions. Guest lectures from [Rumman Chowdhury](https://www.rummanchowdhury.com/) and [Meredith Whittaker](https://ainowinstitute.org/author/meredith-whittaker) where particularly insightful and inspiring.

Some favorite readings from the course:
- [The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas](https://shsdavisapes.pbworks.com/f/Omelas.pdf), Ursula K LeGuin
- [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/241363/weapons-of-math-destruction-by-cathy-oneil/), Cathy O'Neil
- [The Ones Who Stay and Fight](https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-ones-who-stay-and-fight/), N.K. Jemisin
