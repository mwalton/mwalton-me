I'm grateful to the faculty, staff and students at UW's CSSS for the invitation to attend this celebration of the group's 25th anniversary ðŸŽ‰ I gave a short presentation to group's graduate students and took some notes on the workshops and talks I attended:
- [Text as Data Short Course](https://gist.github.com/mwalton/d07cfb6cd9cdfebfb9280cc7a55900ca#file-text_as_data-md)
