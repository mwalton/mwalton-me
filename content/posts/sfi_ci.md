The [Collective Intelligence Symposium & Short Course: Foundations](https://www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/programs/collective-intelligence-2023) hosted by the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/) brought together a transdisciplinary group of researchers, activists and artists interested in intelligent behavior in groups. All of us searching for parallels in the intelligent behavior of various complex systems: social insects, flocking birds, human social organizations and artificial agents. The passion and intellectual curiosity of this eclectic group was infectious and inspiring. In the after-hours, I also attended an excellent debate on societal impacts & harms of AI, contributed early ideas for the formation of the [ACI Journal Club](https://abhishek-gupta.ca/aci/journal-club) and explored [Meow Wolf's House of Eternal Return](https://meowwolf.com/visit/santa-fe).
