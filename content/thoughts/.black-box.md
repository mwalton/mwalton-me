In the center of Regents' Plaza at the University of Michigan there stands an imposing 15' x 15' x 15' steel cube. The object, named *[Endover](https://news.umich.edu/the-cube-in-a/)* was created by sculptor [Tony Rosenthal](https://tonyrosenthal.com/) and installed in 1968.

As I walked through Regents' plaza I noticed a group of students practicing parkour on nearby benches and barriers. I paused for a moment to watch as one of them got a long running start towards the cube. With a leap, a foothold and some clambering he managed to climb to the top of the monument. I noticed that the cube seemed to move, just slightly, as he climbed. Intrigued, I approached. "You can spin it" he called down. I pressed my hand against one of the cube's black metal corners, warm from the afternoon sun, and pushed. I was impressed by how easily the 2,400lb structure could be rotated. I looked back up at the man atop the cube. He gripped the cube's edges as he whimsically spun along with it. As the black box slowed to a halt he hopped down, we exchanged grinning nods and he jogged off to rejoin his comrades.

What we commonly refer to today as "AI" is a black box. Or, more accurately, a particular collection of black boxes: machine learning models. We call these models black boxes in part because they are based on large neural networks (the internal representations and machinations of which are opaque and difficult to interpret). The most popular of these models are controlled by large tech companies. These corporations have, in recent years, become black boxes themselves due to a pattern of poor transparency (or outright secrecy and deception) surrounding their models' training data and implementation. "AI" has become a black box, within a black box.

The black box [has politics](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~beki/cs4001/Winner.pdf).

In researching for this article, I learned that *Endover* is one of a series of sculptures. The original, *Alamo* was installed in East Village, New York in 1967. *Alamo* was [not intended by the artist to be able to spin](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/nyregion/astor-place-cube-new-york.html) but Rosenthal appreciated the addition of this feature so much he built this affordance into *Endover* and designed a mechanism to allow it to revolve more easily than its sister sculpture in New York.

Will the black box be the *end* of us? Is [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man) truly *over*? Perhaps there exists a narrow path by which it can still be redeemed. Offer it in the public square, give the people the power to turn it, tell them "*You* can spin it" and you transform the box into the catalyst of a new world. A world where anyone can climb on top. Where anyone can spin the box. We have to climb. We have to push.
