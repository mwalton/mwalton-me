# Two-Headed Calf
*by Laura Gilpin*

>Tomorrow when the farm boys find this  
freak of nature, they will wrap his body  
in newspaper and carry him to the museum.

>But tonight he is alive and in the north  
field with his mother. It is a perfect  
summer evening: the moon rising over  
the orchard, the wind in the grass. And  
as he stares into the sky, there are  
twice as many stars as usual.
