# The Great Silence
- But I and my fellow parrots are right here. Why aren’t they interested in listening to our voices?
- Some humans theorize that intelligent species go extinct before they can expand into outer space. If they’re correct, then the hush of the night sky is the silence of a graveyard.
- Hundreds of years ago, my kind was so plentiful that the Rio Abajo rainforest resounded with our voices. Now we’re almost gone. Soon this rain forest may be as silent as the rest of the universe
- We parrots used to think humans weren’t very bright. It’s hard to make sense of behavior that’s so different from your own
- So the extinction of my species doesn’t just mean the loss of a group of birds. It’s also the disappearance of our language, our rituals, our traditions. It’s the silencing of our voice.
- Human activity has brought my kind to the brink of extinction, but I don’t blame them for it. They didn’t do it maliciously. They just weren’t paying attention.
