*Digital Molting* is a form of self-curation wherein one "sheds" old centers of digital identity by deleting or archiving old accounts and artifacts. But what of the physical traces of our digital selves? As abstract as an avatar may be, many of the tools we use virtual selves are solidly physical; they come from somewhere, we develop some temporary relationship with them, and when the time comes we shed them as ewaste. Is a discarded device just a mass of aluminum, palladium, and copper?

Lots of peoples put stickers on their laptops. In my experience this isn't necessarily to "beautify" the object. More often, this behavior is meant to broadcast a particular message, communicate an identity or otherwise personalize a piece of bland, mass-produced consumer hardware.

This exercise in personalization it makes me "miss" a laptop when I shed it. Obsolescence or rather I miss the collection of stickers
