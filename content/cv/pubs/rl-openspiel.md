In this report, we present results reproductions for several core algorithms implemented in the OpenSpiel framework for learning in games. The primary contribution of this work is a validation of OpenSpiel's re-implemented search and Reinforcement Learning algorithms against the results reported in their respective originating works. Additionally, we provide complete documentation of hyperparameters and source code required to reproduce these experiments easily and exactly.
