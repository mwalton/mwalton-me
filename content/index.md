Welcome traveler! You've wandered into my humble [[thoughts/digital-forests|forest of ideas]]! 

I'm a researcher committed to imagining and re-imagining our relationship with technology. Integral to this work is a vision for "AI" where access, governance and use are made safe, equitable and sustainable. Many [[fellow_traveler|long roads]] lie ahead, but I doggedly believe better futures are possible.

In my current role as a fellow with [[etf_2023|xD @ The US Census Bureau]] where I'm working on frameworks for operationalizing responsible AI, improving the user experience of [Model Cards](https://bias.xd.gov/) for government use cases and developing new methods for auditing and assessing the impacts of algorithmic systems.

Inspired by [Philip Agre's call](https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/critical.html) for reflexivity in technical practice and motivated by my prior work on [[cv/pubs/dac-rl|multi-agent systems]], [[cv/pubs/tom-rl|reinforcement learning]] & [[cv/pubs/rl-openspiel|game theory]] I'm also critically analyzing the experience of developing autonomous systems in short reflective [essays](https://autopoiesis.substack.com/). I live on a [[farm]] in Washington State where I find constant inspiration from the diversity of life I'm grateful to be immersed in.

Here are some paths you might follow to get to know more about me, my research and interests:
