Welcome traveler! You've wandered into my humble [[thoughts/digital-forests|forest of ideas]]! 

I'm a researcher committed to imagining and re-imagining our relationship with technology. Integral to this work is a vision for "AI" where access, governance and use are made safe, equitable and sustainable. Many [[fellow_traveler|long roads]] lie ahead, but I doggedly believe better futures are possible.

In my current role as a fellow with [[etf_2023|xD @ The US Census Bureau]] I'm working on governance frameworks for operationalizing Responsible AI, improving the user experience of [Model Cards](https://bias.xd.gov/) for government use cases and developing new methods for auditing and assessing the impacts of algorithmic systems.

After a decade spent working on [[cv/pubs/dac-rl|multi-agent systems]], [[cv/pubs/tom-rl|reinforcement learning]] & [[cv/pubs/rl-openspiel|game theory]] I have found value and insight by building [reflexivity](https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/critical.html) into my technical practice. For me, this has taken the form of short reflective [[thoughts/index|essays]].
